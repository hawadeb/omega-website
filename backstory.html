<h1>The Story of Omega: A Journey Through Passion and Persistence</h1>

    <div>
        <h2 class="section-title">Solar:</h2>
        <p>It all began with a menu called Solar, created by Hawa, JOKO, and others. It was the most anticipated and innovative menu at the time. Tragically, someone nuked the server while Hawa was on vacation. At that point, Solar was still just a project run by Hawa. When he returned, everything had changed—new server, new developers, and a new owner: C-A (Solar himself).</p>

        <p>After the reset, I was demoted to admin and co-owner. I was often told, “Learn more code to become owner again.” During that time, I met Entity, and we initially clashed over his server, <i>Artrial</i>. Eventually, we made peace and merged our efforts to form a new menu called <i>OrbitPaid</i>. Unfortunately, this pushed me further into the background, now just an overlooked co-owner.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Artrial:</h2>
        <p>Artrial was created by Entity and Zenkizs. It later merged with Solar to form <i>Orbit</i>, a new and ambitious project.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Orbit:</h2>
        <p>With Orbit, I seriously leveled up my coding skills, hoping to regain ownership. Instead, Cipher (Solar/C-A) and Zenkizs began saying I was never an owner to begin with—just a friend. Feeling disrespected, I teamed up with Entity to build something better.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Omega:</h2>
        <p>With Entity, we brought on Catlicker and KFJ, and Omega was born—an op menu, solid loader, and frequent updates. The server thrived, but personal issues led Entity to delete it and disappear. Hawa stepped in and revived Omega, getting us back on track.</p>

        <p>Entity returned, but later, Hawa decided to quit again and deleted Omega once more. Undeterred, Entity brought it back. Without Hawa, it started declining—until he returned. With Hawa back, Omega surged again, stronger than ever.</p>
